You can read about the theory of this code from the Twitter Scala School:

http://twitter.github.com/scala_school/finagle.html

This style encourages callbacks rather than blocking and makes it much easier
to write multi-threaded code without context switching for non-blocking
code. JDK 8 makes the style readable in Java by introducing lambdas into
the language.

At Twitter we use Scala and have our own library of for Futures[1] and
network programming called Finagle[2]. We find the programming model
to be very powerful but it relies heavily on callbacks which makes it
awkward when calling it from < Java 8. The current implementation will
be difficult to port directly to lambda, so I have started
prototyping a new class called "Promise" that ultimately would
implement some future Java Future interface. I'd love to get feedback
on my progress and some feedback on whether this should be included in
the JDK itself. The API very much resembles the new Collections API
and places where the names differ I'd be happy to rename them.

I've got both a Java 7 (in the jdk7 branch) and Java 8 (master branch)
version running, just for comparison sake. Here is a quick overview of
the API:

Promise:
 void set(T) - satisfy the promise with a value
 void setException(Throwable) - satisfy the promise with a failure
 T get() - wait until the Promise is set and return the value, comparable to Future.get()
 Promise<V> map(Mapper<T, V>) - return a Promise that is satisfied after the mapper maps the underlying Promise value
 Promise<V> flatMap(Mapper<T, Promise<V>>) - return a Promise that is created based on the result of the underlying Promise
 Promise<Pair<T, B>> join(Promise<B>) - return a Promise that is satisfied when both underlying Promises are complete
 Promise<T> select(Promise<T>) - return a Promise that is satisfied when either underlying promise is satisfied
 Promise<T> onSuccess(Block<T>) - execute the Block when the promise is successful
 Promise<T> onFailure(Block<Throwable>) - execute the Block when the promise fails
 Promise<T> ensure(Runnable) - run the runnable on success or failure
 Promise<T> rescue(Mapper<Throwable, T>) - on failure, return the mapped result instead
 Promise<T> onRaise(Block<Throwable>) - react to a signal, often cancellations
 void raise(Throwable e) - send a signal to this Promise and any linked promises
 void link(Promise promise) - link signals between two promises

Promises:
 Promise<T> execute(ExecutorService, Callable<T>) - executes the callable and then sets the Promise to the return value asynchronously
 Promise<? extends List<T>> collect(List<Promise<T>>) - waits until all the Promises are set and then sets a List of results on the returned Promise

Here are some common use cases:

1) User authentication is required to continue processing, cleaning up
no matter what:

userLookup(id).flatMap( u -> u.getUserData())
 .onSuccess(d -> render(d))
 .onFailure(e -> sendError())
 .ensure( () -> cleanup() );

2) Render a scene:

Promises.collect(listOfSceneSegments()).foreach( results ->
displayScene(results));

3) You need two resources to do a third operation:

userData.join(pageData).onSuccess(pair -> render(pair));

4) You want to send 2 requests and take the first one that returns:

request1.select(request2).onSuccess( response -> doSomethind(response));

5) You need to transform your model data to view data before rendering:

getData.map(d -> new ViewData(d)).onSuccess(v -> renderView(v));

6) Render a result message on failure

getPage.map(v -> goodMessage).rescue(e -> badMessage).onSuccess(v ->
renderMessage(v));

My current plan is that if this is interesting to a wide audience I
was going to go down the route of also reimplementing the Future
interface with default methods and making Promise an implementer of
that new interface.
